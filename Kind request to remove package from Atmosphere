Hi @wenape,

I'm one of the Meteor Atmosphere.js moderators. While searching for account guest packages, I found [yours](https://atmospherejs.com/wenape/accounts-guest), which appears to be a very old fork of the @artwells [package](https://atmospherejs.com/artwells/accounts-guest).

Maybe join forces with Art Wells? It's also possible to hide the old package from Atmosphere searches, but still keep it installable by dependent packages and apps:

    meteor admin set-unmigrated wenape:accounts-guest

Thanks,
Dan
